These are some programming books I have found to be worth reading. Most will be available from your local tech bookstore. I've included links because it makes it easy to know which book I'm talking about.

### Effective Java (3rd Edition)
**Author**: Joshua Bloch  
**Link**: [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0134685997). 

If you're going to write java code, you just have to read this book. (I've only read the first 2 editions, but I'm sure the additions for ajva 7, 8, & 9 are worthy.)


### Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
**Author**: Robert C. Martin  
**Link**: [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0132350882).

This is worth reading no matter what language you're using. A compendium of recommendations and anti-recommendations to keep your code maintainable. I would recommend considering all suggestions within, and choose a level of adherance to each one. I can't follow all of them all the time, but I find this book extremely useful when trying to convince engineers that making code understandable is worth the effort. 


### Head First Design Patterns
**Authors**: Elisabeth Freeman, Eric Freeman, Bert Bates, Kathy Sierra, & Elisabeth Robson  
**Link**: [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0596007124).

A very approachable introduction to design patterns, made famous by the [book by the gang of four](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201633612). These are concepts that are reusable across languages to help structure your code.
